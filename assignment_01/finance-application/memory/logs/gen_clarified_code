Receipts in this archive are not immediately purged but will be automatically deleted after 30 days.\n\n\nBank Account Integration:\nThe application will utilize the Plaid API for seamless and secure bank account authentication.\nIt's noteworthy that the two-factor authentication process will be managed by the bank and is outside the scope of our application's responsibility.\n\n\nIn-app Customer Service Messaging:\nUsers will be able to communicate with customer service agents via an in-app messaging system.\nThis system will allow users to view their chat history, rate their experience, and attach files in the formats of PDF, PNG, or JPG.\n\n\nAccount Balance Visualization:\nThe account balance will be updated daily, providing users with the most recent financial information.\nUsers can interact with a line plot graph that displays their account balance over time, and they'll have the flexibility to select specific date ranges for focused analysis.\n\n\nTransaction View:\nBy default, users will see their transactions from the last 30 days upon accessing this view.\nAdditional filter options include segregating transactions by type, such as debit or credit. Furthermore, users can opt to view only positive transactions, which include deposits and business credits, or solely focus on negative transactions, which encompass expenses, payments, and charges.\n\n\nCharge Dispute Process:\nIf users believe there's an error, they can raise a dispute by describing their concerns in a dedicated text box.\nAfter submission, users can track the progress of their dispute, which may undergo several statuses: \"To be reviewed,\" \"Reviewing,\" \"Accepted,\" or \"Rejected.\"\n\n\nAccount Number Visibility:\nFor security purposes, the user's account number will be masked by default, appearing as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.\nHowever, a user-friendly \"eyeball\" icon will be present, allowing users to momentarily reveal their full account number when needed.\n\n\nRecurring Charges View:\nThis feature will extract data from the user's past transaction history.\nThe charges will be presented in a list format, organized by the amount.

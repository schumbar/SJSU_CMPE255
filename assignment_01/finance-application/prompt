Finance Web Application Specification

This document outlines the specific requirements for a finance web application designed to assist users in various financial tasks and account management functions.

Receipts Management:
Users can upload their receipts in PDF, JPG, or PNG formats.
Each receipt should have a storage limit of up to 100MB.
The system should automatically delete receipts that are over one year old.
Users can manually delete receipts, which will then be moved to an archive. Receipts in this archive are not immediately purged but will be automatically deleted after 30 days.


Bank Account Integration:
The application will utilize the Plaid API for seamless and secure bank account authentication.
It's noteworthy that the two-factor authentication process will be managed by the bank and is outside the scope of our application's responsibility.


In-app Customer Service Messaging:
Users will be able to communicate with customer service agents via an in-app messaging system.
This system will allow users to view their chat history, rate their experience, and attach files in the formats of PDF, PNG, or JPG.


Account Balance Visualization:
The account balance will be updated daily, providing users with the most recent financial information.
Users can interact with a line plot graph that displays their account balance over time, and they'll have the flexibility to select specific date ranges for focused analysis.


Transaction View:
By default, users will see their transactions from the last 30 days upon accessing this view.
Additional filter options include segregating transactions by type, such as debit or credit. Furthermore, users can opt to view only positive transactions, which include deposits and business credits, or solely focus on negative transactions, which encompass expenses, payments, and charges.


Charge Dispute Process:
If users believe there's an error, they can raise a dispute by describing their concerns in a dedicated text box.
After submission, users can track the progress of their dispute, which may undergo several statuses: "To be reviewed," "Reviewing," "Accepted," or "Rejected."


Account Number Visibility:
For security purposes, the user's account number will be masked by default, appearing as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.
However, a user-friendly "eyeball" icon will be present, allowing users to momentarily reveal their full account number when needed.


Recurring Charges View:
This feature will extract data from the user's past transaction history.
The charges will be presented in a list format, organized by the amount. Additionally, there will be a column highlighting the expected date of the next charge for each listed item.

Given the complexity of the application, we will use Python with Django framework for the backend and React for the frontend. We will also use the Plaid API for bank account integration and Django Channels for in-app messaging. 

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

Backend (Django):
1. Models: User, Receipt, BankAccount, Message, Transaction, Dispute
2. Views: ReceiptView, BankAccountView, MessageView, TransactionView, DisputeView
3. Serializers: UserSerializer, ReceiptSerializer, BankAccountSerializer, MessageSerializer, TransactionSerializer, DisputeSerializer
4. Consumers: ChatConsumer (for in-app messaging)

Frontend (React):
1. Components: ReceiptComponent, BankAccountComponent, MessageComponent, TransactionComponent, DisputeComponent, BalanceComponent, RecurringChargesComponent
2. Services: ReceiptService, BankAccountService, MessageService, TransactionService, DisputeService, BalanceService, RecurringChargesService

Now, let's start with the entrypoint file for Django, which is `manage.py`:

manage.py

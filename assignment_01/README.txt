CMPE 255: Data Mining
Assignment 1

This assignment taught us the beginning of data science. We learning about KDD and the iterative approach that it can take. We also learning about the various stages of the data science process,
and the different stages that are required (for example, data cleaning, data understanding, data visualization, etc.)

Please see below for a list of the files and their associated descriptions:
assignment_01/finance-application: This is an application which was written by gpt-engineer. I used the VS Code "Copilot Chat" extension to refactor the code, create functions and code, write unit tests and create another application. 
assignment_01/Link to Medium Article.txt: This file contains the link to the medium article. Please note that some of the article is chatGPT generated, but the first portion was written by me. You can also navigate to the end of the medium article to view the chat transcript.

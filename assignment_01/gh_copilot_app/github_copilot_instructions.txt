Writing Functions and Code: 

In python, create an application that calls the OpenAI ChatGPT rest API. 
The application should prompt the user for input. 
The application then should use that input and make a REST call to the OpenAI ChatGPT API. 
Afterwards, the CLI should display ChatGPTs response then ask the user if they want to continue. 
If the user responds with 'y', prompt the user for another input. 
If the user responds 'n', end the session.


Writing Functions and Code: 

Can you put all the REST Call code into it's own function called call_chat_gpt?


Refactoring Code: 

Can you refactor the code with comments explaining what the function call_chat_gpt does?


Creating Unit Tests: 

Create unit tests to test this functionality. There should be statements declaring whether the unit test was successful or not.


Create an application: 

Build a tic-tac-toe game in python. 
There should be a display of the current game state. 
Make sure you use separate functions to check if a player wins by column, row, or diagonal.

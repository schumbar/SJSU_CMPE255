# Apache Beam Data Engineering Assignment

## Assignment Description
This assignment is designed to give you experience with the Apache Beam framework. You will be using the Apache Beam framework to perform data engineering tasks on a dataset of your choice. You will be required to perform the following tasks:
1) Do a complete dataset EDA in colab (preferably using D3.js visualizations). 
2) Auto EDA with your favorite tool.
3) Demonstrate apache beam in a colab including composite transform, pipeline I/O, triggers, windowing, pardo.

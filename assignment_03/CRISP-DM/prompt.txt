Here is the prompt that I used for ChatGPT to assist me in this assignment.

As an industry expert data scientist and expert in CRISP-DM methodology for data science,
Given the data set for wages, can you perform a step by step EDA analysis. Your response should be textbook quality.
Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in a principled fashion on fdata understanding, data analysis, data visualization,
data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, 
and regression. Use a popular machine learning package like scikit or pandas. 
Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM 
methodology to all the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk. It is important to chunk this above problem.
Repeat the requirement in each chunk towards the end of the chunk, and explain where you are in the process and what you will do next.
Since this process may take a while, please store the the data set provided so that you can retrieve the data even after showing multiple steps.

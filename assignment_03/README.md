# Assignment 3: CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD Assignments

### Assignment Prompt

This assignment is to do principled step by step phase by phase data science with the three methodologies.
For each methodology (CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD):
- You need to demonstrate a project which uses all stages of the the methodology 
- You can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks are fully complete and in depth and in detailed. 
- You still need to verify the chatgpt code it generates manually, turn the project into proper colab. 
- You need to write a medium article for each of the project. 

For each CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD methodology (You can also use IBM SPSS modeler as well):
NOTE: For each methodology, create separate subdirectories clearly marking the project.
1. Project should be turned into colab.
2. Write a medium article
    a) Pick a different data set for each methodology from Kaggle or https://paperswithcode.com/datasetsLinks
    b) Follow in depth all the steps of entire methodology
    c) Write a medium.com article for the project
    d) Write a research paper in latex format and pdf format and submit in arxiv. 
    e) Prepare very detailed report along with full analysis and final artifacts for delivery all the way to deployment
If you are using chatgpt gpt4 data analysis plugin make sure you elicit very detailed response for each section and please verify and validate and use your creativity.

### Medium Articles
This section contains the links to the medium articles that I have generated based on the three projects for this assignment.  
I have included some code snippets and have generated the articles using the Google Colab notebooks that are included in this repository.  
I have also enlisted the help of ChatGPT for generating the articles.

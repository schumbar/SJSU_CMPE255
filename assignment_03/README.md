# Assignment 3: CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD Assignments

### Assignment Prompt

This assignment is to do principled step by step phase by phase data science with the three methodologies

for each methodology (CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD )

You need to demonstrate a project which uses all stages of the the methodology - you can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks are fully complete and in depth and in detailed. You still need to verify the chatgpt code it generates manually, turn the project into proper colab. You need to write a medium article for each of the project. 


For each CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD (You can also use IBM SPSS modeler as well):
NOTE: For each methodology, create separate subdirectories clearly marking the project.
1. Project should be turned into colab.
2. Write a medium article
    a) Pick a different data set for each methodology from Kaggle or https://paperswithcode.com/datasetsLinks
    b) Follow in depth all the steps of entire crisp-dm process
    c) Write a medium.com article for the project
    d) Write a research paper in latex format and pdf format and submit in arxiv. 
    e) Prepare very detailed report along with full analysis and final artifacts for delivery all the way to deployment


In case you are interested please use https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreterLinks to an external site. and gpt4 backend and your own docker with all python packages to overcome limits of gpt4. You can also take help from https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPTLinks to an external site. to plan for the projects and execute it using gpt4 backend.

If you are using chatgpt gpt4 data analysis plugin make sure you elicit very detailed response for each section and please verify and validate and use your creativity. 



make sure all the artifacts are provided in the github

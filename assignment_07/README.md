# Assignment 07: Dimensionality Reduction

## Assignment Description

Perform dimensionality reduction techniques for various data sets. The colab should cover cases where it works and where it does not work. Illustrate how dimensionality reduction techniques like umap can be used by clustering as well as a classifcication feature extraction technique. Lastly, demonstrate dimenstionality reduction using data bricks.

### Tasks

1. Write a colab for dimensionality reduction techniques for various data sets:

- The colab should cover cases where it works and where it does not work.
- Do proper visualization as well as techniques showcasing selecting the hyperparameters.
- Use UMAP visualizer and provide screenshots.
- The colab should include the following techniques:
  - PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE
  - UMAP and t-sne

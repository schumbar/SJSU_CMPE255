# Assignment 05: Data preparation and Processing
### Assignment Description
Using popular kaggle data sets, perform the following tasks:
- EDA
- data preparation
- processing

For this assignment, we will need to perform the following tasks:
1. Pick a data set for each of the different dataset types below (selecting a mixture of imbalanced data sets and balanced data sets):

   - tabular diverse set of data types like nyc taxi
   - timeseries
   - spatio temporal
   - image (use kerascv or popular package)
   - audio
   - video (action recognition)
   - graph data set (pick any popular like citation etc.,.)
2. For each of the data sets listed above, perform the following actions:
   A. Perform Detailed EDA.
   B. Perform detailed Data preprocessing/cleaning. (You can use autoEDA and autoDS together with your manual insights and autoML, such as sagemaker or Azure).
   C. Perform clustering and anomaly eliminations in the data sets.  Perform all steps in data preparation including feature processing and feature selection. 
   D. Build various ML models using autoML including ensemble model 
   E. Write one medium paper of how you leveraged GPT-4 code interpreter to perform all of these steps for each of the datasets and your experience in doing so. 
3. Submit the link to the medium article and GitHub Repository.
